    <p>When I started with this webpage, I was clear I wanted to talk about my country (I am from Colombia, but I live in Spain).
         Colombia is a beautiful country, very diverse, thus it has a lot of things to talk about.
         I finally chose to talk about Colombian independence. The idea arose because we were in the 7th of August
          (Battle of Boyaca ) also I consider it a very interesting issue where Spain and Colombia are involved,
           countries in which I have lived.<br>
           I will just make a summary to create a context about the Colombian situation. Also, I am not a professional investigator,
            and this is my first time talking about Colombian history.<br>
        Given the above, I show you a bunch of dates of Colombia.</p>

            alt="comunero revolt" width="400px">
            On March 16, 1781, in Socorro in northeastern Colombia, grocer Manuela Beltrán tore down posted edicts about 
            new tax increases and other changes that would have reduced the profits of the colonists and enlarged the 
            benefits of Spain. Many other towns in New Granada began to have the same occurrences with colonists livid 
            about the conditions of the ruling government. Local residents began to assemble and elect a body of officials 
            known as el común, or a central committee "to lead the movement." The rebels unified under the leadership 
            of Juan Francisco Berbeo, a Criollo elite. Despite coming from the upper classes of society, the rebels introduced 
            the idea of unifying and organising the diverse social classes comprising common people; the endorsement of 
            the elites improved the rebels' efforts to unify, where Berbeo consolidated 10,000 to 20,000 rebel troops to 
            march on Bogotá, the capital. Once the rebels defeated the rival soldiers sent from Bogotá, they reached a town 
            slightly north of it, where Spanish officials agreed to meet with the Comuneros and sign an agreement stating 
            the conditions and complaints of the rebels. However, once the rebels disbanded, the Spanish government 
            officials signed a document that discarded the agreement on the basis that it was forced upon them. <img class="Rigth_Images" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/4de54a_f58d48a27b15458bb9fb54df94ee28b5~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_381,h_438,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/4de54a_f58d48a27b15458bb9fb54df94ee28b5~mv2.webp"
            alt="José Antonio Galan" width="300"><br> Once 
            reinforcements for the Spanish government arrived, they were sent to rebellious cities and towns to enforce 
            the implementation of the increased taxes. José Antonio Galán, one of the leaders of the revolt, continued on 
            with a small number of rebels, including Jose Manuel Ortiz Manosalvas, but they were quickly defeated and executed, 
            while other leaders of the rebellion were sentenced for life in prison for treason.<br><br><br>

 
            

The influence of the revolt led to similar uprisings, with a similar outcome, as far north as Mérida and Timotes, now in Venezuela 
but at the time under jurisdiction of the Viceroyalty of New Granada.

The city of Barinas defeated the Comuneros of the Venezuelan Andes (1781), a fact that led to King Carlos IV 
granting it in 1790 the coat of arms that today retains the state capital, along with the motto "very noble and very 
loyal"..<br><br>

    <h3 id="the_vase_of_Llorente">The vase of Llorente</h3>

    <p>On the morning of July 20, 1810, Joaquín Caco went to the residence of Viceroy Antonio José Amar y Borbón to request 
        a response to a request for the establishment of a government junta in Santa Fe, plus the viceroy's refusal to his 
        Arrogance caused the revolt to be formed with the excuse of the loan of a vase, and there the supposed cry of 
        Independence began in 1810 on July 20.<br><br>

        It is then worth mentioning one of the most important causes for the formation of these boards with the following quote;<br><br>
        
        The Casa del Florero, where the events of July 20, 1810 occurred, is currently the headquarters of the El Museo 
        de la Independencia - Casa del Florero .<br><br>
        
        Luis Rubio went to visit the business of José González Llorente to borrow a vase in order to use it at 
        dinner visit to the royal commissioner Antonio Villavicencio (born in Quito). The Creoles knew that Llorente 
        refusal would lend the vase, because he would not pay anything to the Creoles to meet other Creole.<br><br>
        
        For this reason, once the loan of Llorente's vase was denied, the Creoles, as they had planned from the previous 
        day, used the occasion to warm the spirits of the people against the Spanish, in this way the vase was the excuse 
        to generate the revolt.<br><br> <img class="Left_Images" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/planet4-colombia-stateless/2019/07/ce862a91-gpc_independencia_02-1-1024x683.jpg"
        alt="The vase of Llorente" width="400">
        
        Instantly, Francisco de Morales Fernández rebuked Caldas for the way Llorente treated the creoles with expletives, 
        which provoked a turbulent response from the people, attacking Llorente. The mayor of Santa Fe, José Miguel Pey, 
        tried to calm the town by removing Llorente, while José María Carbonell encouraged the inhabitants to join the 
        protest.<br><br>
        
        At the end of the afternoon, things calmed down, and the members of the Board were appointed, at the request 
        of José Acevedo and Gómez (for which history would later call him El tribuno del Pueblo ), but the appointment 
        of the viceroy as president of the Board he provoked the animosity of the people.<br><br>
        
        Finally, an attempt was made to crush the popular demonstration through the Spanish commander Juan Sámano, for which 
        reason Acevedo y Goméz himself warned the people to declare anyone who opposed the newly constituted Junta a 
        criminal of lese majesty . Subsequently, an open council was called , to then arrest the oidores and the viceroy, 
        which would become effective on the 21st and on July 26, the Board of the Regency Council was declared free.</p><br>

    alt="The Foolish Fatherland" width="250">
    <p>The Foolish Fatherland is the period in the history of Colombia immediately following the declaration of 
        independence from Spain in 1810 and until the Spanish reconquest in 1816. The period between 1810 and 1816 
        in the Viceroyalty of New Granada (which included present-day Colombia) was marked by such intense conflicts 
        over the nature of the new government or governments that it became known as la Patria Boba (the Foolish 
        Fatherland). Constant fighting between federalists and centralists gave rise to a prolonged period of instability 
        that eventually favored Spanish reconquest. Similar developments can be seen at the same time in the United 
        Provinces of the Río de la Plata. Each province, and even some cities, set up its own autonomous junta, which 
        declared themselves sovereign from each other.<br><br></p>

    alt="Spanish Reconquest of New Granada" width="300">
    <p>The Spanish Invasion of New Granada in 1815–1816 was part of the Spanish American wars of independence 
        in South America. Shortly after the Napoleonic Wars ended, Ferdinand VII, recently restored to the throne 
        in Spain, decided to send military forces to retake most of the northern South American colonies, which 
        had established autonomous juntas and independent states. The invaders, with support from loyal colonial 
        troops, completed the reconquest of New Granada by taking Bogotá on May 6, 1816.<br><br></p>

    <h3 id="Colombian_Declaration_of_Independence">Colombian Declaration of Independence</h3>

    <p>On August 7, 1819, after Bolívar secured a narrow victory at Vargas Swamp Battle, 
        both armies headed towards Bogotá, which was lightly defended. The capture of the 
        capital in the hands of the Patriot Army would effectively cut off the advance of the 
        republican army and give the strategic initiative to its opponents. At 6:00 a.m., the 
        Spanish forces (Newgranadians-Venezuelan loyalist soldiers) departed from Motavita 
        towards Casa de Teja, a distance of only 25 km which the Spaniards completed in 7 
        hours 30 minutes, at an average pace of 18 minutes per kilometer. At 10:00 a.m. 
        General Santander's forces departed from Tunja toward Casa de Piedra and the road 
        to Bogota. The Patriot forces completed the 16 km in 4 hours (at an average pace 
        of 15 minutes per kilometer).<br><br>

        The Republican forces split in two: the vanguard reached 
        Casa de Teja at 1:30 p.m., while the rearguard stopped a 
        kilometer and a half behind to get some rest. Shortly before 
        2:00 p.m., Capitan Andres Ibarra and his forces spotted Casa 
        de Teja and the vanguard of the Republican Army. The Spaniards 
        spotted him too, and Coronel Sebastian Dias, chief of the 
        vanguard of the Spanish army ordered to follow and engage what 
        he believed was only a small observation force. They returned and General 
        Santander ordered Lieutenant Coronel Paris to attack the Republican forces.<br><br>
        <img class="Left_Images" src="https://www.elespectador.com/resizer/CfTF9KLdZTAkAUGpz_XnMXcJMFQ=/657x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/elespectador/TJE4LOFBVJCBXFIQJNUWBNU3SY.jpg" alt="colombian independence" 
        width="400">
        
        The Spanish vanguard crossed a strategic bridge over the Teatinos River and took attack 
        positions there. Meanwhile, the full force of the Patriot army under Santander had reached 
        Casa de Piedra. The Spanish rearguard was still several kilometers behind, so General 
        Anzoátegui ordered to block the way between the vanguard and the rearguard of the Spanish 
        forces. The rearguard, outnumbered, retreated to a small hill close to Casa de Piedra.<br><br>

        Simón Bolívar's forces arrived from Paipa, after the Vargas Swamp battle. He ordered a 
        flank attack on the Spanish rearguard: battalions Barcelona and Bravos de Paez were to 
        attack on the right side while the Legion Britanica and Rifles Battalion attacked on the 
        left. The enemy assumed battle positions: in the center were three artillery pieces 
        surrounded by royal battalions 12 and 22, and on the wings, cavalry units. Arthur 
        Sandes commander of Rifles Battalion charges the royalist artillery. Outnumbered, 
        the Spanish rear guard began to retreat without any clear direction. Therefore, Bolívar 
        ordered lancers units to attack the center of the Republican infantry, while a full 
        cavalry squadron ran away from the battle via the road towards Samaca. Bareiro attempted 
        to break the blockage of the Patriot forces and rendezvous with the Spanish vanguard but 
        heavy enemy fire forced him and his forces to surrender.<br><br>

        <img class="Rigth_Images" src="https://colombiareports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/independence2.jpg" alt="colombian independence" 
        width="400">
        Meanwhile, one kilometer and a half behind Casa de 
        Piedra, the Patriot vanguard managed to ford the river and was approaching the 
        rear of the Republican vanguard force. Once it reached them, the vanguard forces 
        engaged in battle, while the rearguard attempted to cross the river by force, using 
        bayonets. The Spanish forces fled, leaving on the bridge their leader, Coronel Juan 
        Taira. As the assembly of enemy prisoners began, the battle was over shortly after 4:00 p.m.<br><br>
        
        At least 1,600 troops and several of the Spanish commanders, including Barreiro 
        himself, were captured at the end of the battle. New Granada's liberation was assured 
        by this victory, which left the road to Bogotá and the city itself practically undefended, 
        as the survivors headed towards other locations. After the battle, Santander and Anzoátegui 
        were promoted to Divisional General. On the orders of Santander, Colonel Barreiro and 38 
        more were executed in Bogotá on October 11, 1819, because of the Decree of War to the Death.<br><br>
        
        The bridge in question, el Puente de Boyacá, is no longer in use but it has been maintained 
        as a symbol of the Independence of South America.<br><br></p>

    <h3 id="Battle_of_Lake_Maracaibo">Battle of Lake Maracaibo</h3>

    <p>The Battle of Lake Maracaibo also known as the "Naval Battle of the Lake" was fought on 24 
        July 1823 on Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo between fleets under the commands of Republican 
        Admiral José Prudencio Padilla and royalist Captain Ángel Laborde.<br><br>
        <img class="Left_Images" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Acci%C3%B3n_del_castillo_de_Maracaibo.jpg"
        alt="battle of Maracaibo" width="400"> 

        The engagement was won by the Republican forces, and was the last battle of the Venezuelan 
        War of Independence and the larger Spanish American wars of independence. The Republican 
        ships were part of the armed forces of Gran Colombia led by Simón Bolívar.<br><br>

        The Battle of Carabobo of 1821 is usually seen in the historiography as the culminating 
        battle for Venezuelan independence. However, some historians point out that if the Battle 
        of Lake Maracaibo had been a victory for the Royalist forces, the Spanish Crown might have 
        been able to establish a new front in Western Venezuela from which to attack the Republican 
        forces stationed in Venezuela. As a result of the defeat, the Spanish did not send any 
        reinforcing regiments to Venezuela, and finally accepted Venezuelan independence as a 
        result of this second decisive Republican victory, although it did not formally recognise 
        the new nation's independence for more than a decade afterward.<br><br>
        
        The 24 July is a regional holiday of Zulia State in Venezuela, and as it is also the date 
        of the birth of Simón Bolívar, is also marked as Navy Day in both Venezuela and Colombia.<br><br></p>
        <h3 id="conclusion">conclusion and Purpose of the page</h3>
        <p>To conclude, we can see that the process for Colombia to be a unitary, social and democratic 
            state of law whose form of government is presidential has been something in many years not 
            of a couple of dates as is often said in popular culture<br><br>
            I will not go into judging or giving my personal opinion about such historical events since
             I am in favour that history should not be judged, only known and learned from it<br><br>
             now explaining a little the reason for this website. The idea arose from the fact that
              now I am a Colombian emigrant resident in Spain and I found it interesting to talk or
               to make known a little this time in which Colombia and Spain are totally related<br><br>
               por ultimo quisiera comentar algo personal, la razón por la cual emigre a España
                están relacionadas con violencia en mi país de origen, se suele pensar que la
                 violencia es un tema muy reciente, que es algo que se genera a partir del
                  paramilitarismo o el narcotrafico en Colombia y es totalmente lo contrario.<br><br>
                  giving rise to a well-heard phrase:<br><br>
                  <em>"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it." </em> 
                  by Napoleon Bonaparte and/or Jorge Agustín Nicolás Ruiz de Santayana</p>
