                    <p>There is so much to learn about animation because it is now recognized as an important art form. 
                        People no longer view animation as childish as they did in the past.</p>

                    <p>Animation is method in which figures are manipulatedto appear as moving images
                    In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and 
                    exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation  
                    can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) 
                    can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply 
                    a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets or clay figures.

                    <h3>Animation Techniques</h3>
                    <h4>Cel animation</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Norman_McLaren_drawing_on_film_-_1944.jpg"
                    alt="Cel animation" width="20%">
                    <p>This is the original hand-drawn cel animation where the artist literally has to draw thousands of images 
                        on special paper and have them photographed, frame by frame. 
                        Before the digital revolution, traditional animation was the norm of the industry, including Disney</p>
                    <h4>2D Animation</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Antics_2-D_Animation_infobox_screenshot.png"
                    alt="2D Animation" width="20%">
                    <P>This is vector-based animation, and has two distinct advantages: it is cheap and easy to access. 
                        You need a basic understanding of key frames and know how to use Adobe Animate CC.</P>
                    <h4>3D Animation</h4>
                    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/820083125451505664/QS9HlwoM_400x400.jpg" alt="3D Animation" width="20%">
                    <p>3D animation and visual effects are, quite simply, the way of the future. 3D animation operates on different principles, and 
                        is more akin to puppetry than traditional animation. For this, you need to learn how to 
                        digitally model a character, sculpt it perfectly and give it a skeleton that you can move and manipulate.</p>
                    <h4>Motion Graphics</h4>
                    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/MDjAPc6BR7qz49gkLbk3SCVrOVH22CcZvIrD1JfJZJaIRNjvPOf3DKhOkGyfCaA7Wh38v4btpXzQ4iARKFXugPdP8IL4WmdTCc87cKI84nXu"
                    alt="Motion Graphics" width="20%">
                    <p>This visual effect technique involves moving graphic elements such as text or 
                        logos, mostly using software such as After Effects.<br>
                        Works Best For: Those working in the advertising industry or doing multimedia 
                        projects, or even designing the opening of film titles.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Stop Motion</h4>
                    <img src="https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Stefano_Bessoni_Canti_2014-1024x631.jpg"
                     alt="Stop Motion" width="20%">
                     <p>Stop motion is like traditional animation, except instead of drawing, you have clay models 
                         and a set that you have to carefully manipulate to produce animation. Stop motion 
                         can also be done with puppets, cut-outs, silhouettes and even action figures. 
                         In the past, stop motion was used as a form of special effects for 
                         live-action films, and has largely been replaced by 3D animation and visual effects work.</p>

                        ou don’t have to be a cartoonist to have animation be a big part of your life. Animation
                        is everywhere—in our homes, schools, work,
                        and everywhere there’s a screen. And if you grew up in
                        the United States, chances are you’ve witnessed seminal accomplishments 
                        in animation history without even<br>
                        
                        knowing it. Does Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs ring
                        a bell? What about Toy Story…or The Flintstones? These
                        works marked important milestones in animation, an
                        art form that continuously challenges its creators to
                        push technology so that anything that can be imagined
                        can also be brought to life.</p>
